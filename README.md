# Calculator
Between Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal and Decimal

The C program performs addition, subtraction and multiplication in binary, octal, hexadecimal and decimal formats, without using the printf formatting built-in in C.

Example input and output:

`$ ./calc “*” d5 d10 d`

`d50`


`$ ./calc “+” x3C b1010 o`

`o106`


`$ ./calc “-“ -d5 -d3 d`

`-d2`
